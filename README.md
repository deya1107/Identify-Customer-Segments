# Installation

# Project Motivation
This is the third project of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
